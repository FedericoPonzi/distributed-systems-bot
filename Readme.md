## Distributed Systems bot
@distribsystems

This bot has the following aims:

 1. Tweet links from feeds of interesting websites. [Done]
 1. Retweet and like "interesting" tweets
 3. Schedule posts based on a publication timetable (with exceptions - like "publish now"), made from a Telegram bot interface.
 4. Save every tweet in the database, to do some analysis - based on interactions.
 5. A web based interface to let users review the sources of news.
 6. Use a shortlink system while publishing tweets, to track clicks and understand 
        which feeds are more interesting for the users.

## 1. Feed RSS
At the moment, the bot is mainly using the free service from iffft.com (thanks!).

I'm working on an alternative which will better suits the needs of the bot.

## 3. Telegram bot + post at
Why telegram? Because I like the option to schedule a post by just sending a message on Telegram.
